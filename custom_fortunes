I argue very well. Ask any of my remaining friends. I can win an argument on any
topic, against any opponent. People know this, and steer clear of me at parties.
Often, as a sign of their great respect, they don't even invite me.

The Sophisticate: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or
pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else."

The Zetet: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade.
You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a
one-color view ..."

A friend once told me that I look at the world as if I've never seen it before.
I thought, that's a nice compliment... Wait! I never have seen it before!
What---did everyone else get a preview?
