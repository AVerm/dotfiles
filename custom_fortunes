The Sophisticate: "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or
pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else."

window, you will die sooner than you expect.

Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself.
Basically, it's made up of two separate words: "mank" and "ind." What do these
words mean? It's a mystery, and that's why so is mankind.
